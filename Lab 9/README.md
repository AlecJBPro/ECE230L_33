## Lab Summary
In this lab, we used multiplexers and demultiplexers for signal routing. We learned how to implement MUXes and DEMUXes on Verilog. First, we implemented a 4-input mulitplexer that chooses from four inputs that are 4 bits, depending on the selector bits and enable. Then we implemented a demultiplexer that takes a 4-bit input and routes it to one of the four outputs depending on the selector and enable. Then we combined both modules in top.v to form a complete system. To implement the MUXes and DEMUXes, we used chained ternary statements, concatenation and logic expressions, so we also learned about them. 

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer is like a switch that selects one input from multiple input signals by using selector bits and then sends it to a single output. Multiplexers are useful in situations where you have multiple sources of information and you only want to use one of them at a time.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer is the opposite of a multiplexer. It takes a single input and sends it to one of multiple output lines according to the selector. Demultiplexers are useful when a single information has to be sent to different destinations.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
According to Shannon's Expansion Theorem, any boolean function can be written by implementing multiplexers and demultiplexers. They can also be used for data routing, memory addressing and etc.
