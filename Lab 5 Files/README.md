# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.

The top level file connects all the equation files into one and assigns the inputs and outputs to the physical board switches and leds.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.

The funciton of the contraints file is to open up which board switches and leds are to be used and preps it for use.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?

Yes the selection of the minterms and maxterms were correct for each circuit, which gave us the output of the second circuit properly. I would've chosen the minterms for both as it would make it easier to calculate and less work when it comes to identifying the simplified equations.
